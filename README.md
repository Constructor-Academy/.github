SIT Academy is a coding and data science academy offering a variety of full-time, part-time, or self-paced programs to motivated learners looking to enhance their careers with technology.

### Our mission

We give people new professional opportunities by unleashing their hidden potential and turning them into the effective software developers and data scientists the industry so desperately needs. SIT Academy graduates live the dream of the digital revolution by learning the tools to build tomorrow's disruptive technologies.

### Our methods

Through a hands-on and project-based approach, our teaching methods consists of a combination of lectures and follow-on exercises. With a strong industry focus, our programs are designed to simulate a real-work environment, from the technologies we teach, the team-work between students, to the projects they work on. Every module ends with a project so that students use what they learned. The final Capstone Project is done in collaboration with industry.

## What you'll find here

On our github we mostly publish projects made by our studnets during their final projcts, but you will also find some other useful resources.
